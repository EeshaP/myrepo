##Examine the data
This is just a piece of writing here about cars. Miles per gallon, I think. Oh wait and there's something about highways too. Wow very interesting. Why can't I just use word tho. It has tables. 
Although...
It's kind of fun writing this. Ok bye.
Wait I gotta write a little more. This R thing is kind of fun right?





```{r }
head(mpg)
dim(mpg)
mpg.2008 <- mpg[mpg$year==2008, ]
head(mpg.2008)
```
## is there a relationship btwn engine displacement and highway mileage?

```{r }

cor(mpg.2008$hwy, mpg.2008$displ)
m1 <- lm(hwy~displ, data=mpg.2008)
summary(m1)
```
